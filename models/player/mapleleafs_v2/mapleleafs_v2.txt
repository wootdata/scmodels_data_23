This model is a reskin of the Turgeon model by k_vandorn (kvandorn@kupperparker.com).

It is basically a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player.

I know, all you hardcore hockey fans, that the "maple leaf" emblem is from the white jersey, 
but I think it looks cool on the blue jersey.

Also, the face is Turgeon from St. Louis Blues, but I don't have the skill or the time to
figure out how to get Mats Sundin's face on the model!  I did knock a couple of his teeth out 
to give him that "bad-ass" hockey player vibe though!


BUT I think the model is cool anyhow, please use it!
