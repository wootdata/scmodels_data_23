playmate v1.2, (c) Bert Lancaster, all rights reserved
3D artist: Steve Theodore
This is an edit of the Gina model, her face has been revised 
and certain key portions of her clothing are gone!

Place the two playmate files in a folder called playmate in the

\sierra\half-life\valve\models\player folder.

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  The .bmp file is
necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  For
a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, it does not download the
.bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: models must be
deliberately installed by the player.
