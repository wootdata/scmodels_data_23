"People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their
soul to the land of the dead...but sometimes, something so bad happens
that a terrible sadness is carried with it, and the soul can't rest.

...Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right."


A dead guy with a vengence and a bucket of face paint...nuff said!


INSTALLATION
------------
Just extract to your Half-Life base directory.


*NOTE*
This is my first real attempt at player modelling (or any modelling
for that matter) and it still needs a bit of work but it serves its
purpose.  When i get some time, I'll do some custom animations for him.


P.S. Thanks to Scarecrow for the helpful tutes and Andrew & Jason at QANTM,
     Brisbane Australia.

     Have Fun :)
