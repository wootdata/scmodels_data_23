Skeleton

This is a skin thats a bit evil, a perfect fow to
the space ghost skin I created eariler. It was made using
Photoimpact, The skins.zip file, for a source. and compiler
and mdlviewer for viewing, (can't get HL to run here at work :)
If you enjoy it let me know. Im working on new skins all the time.
Hopefully this won't be the last on the net.

To install create a directory called SKELETON  copy these files into it.
once installed it can be picked from the multiplayer options.

Future skins will include Paintball, varations of the Suits, and 
probably some newer Robo skins. as soon As I get around to it.


this is freeware. But if you want it on your cd. I just want a copy of the CD.
