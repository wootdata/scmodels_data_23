Time spent on this model: Approximately one and a half days.

Known Problems:

1) Although the torso looks different with the small sudden reduction in near the middle (it creates a visible line looking thing around him) (excuse me if im confusing you, It's hard to explain.) it is supposed to be that way.

Interesting things: 

1)Collapsing Butt Syndrome is eliminated by the pelvis design.
2)I think the legs look darn cool :)

Comments:

This is my first DeathMatch model ever made, but I am not new to modeling, however.  The Poly count I think is rather low according to my brain.  The skin was created by me.  This model used to have bangs on his head that were split, but I deleted those faces to save texture space. I feel everyone should use only 1 256x256 :O)  But that's just me.  Anyways just try this dude out.  If you followed my installation instructions, you'll soon be stylin' with ur Kabuto buddy, soon as you stop reading this rambling section.  Now go and frag with... Kabuto.  (WARNING: Kabuto will NOT make you a better player.  He was designed for a neat look.  And as an experiment.  In no way am I responsible for you getting your @$$ kicked at Half-Life.  It is NOT my fault.  It is only yours.  Or your ISP or your modem.  Or your computer. Whatever.  Nite 'yall.
